# simpleregression
The aim of this project is to find the best fitting line for the payment of salaries and the years of experience
This is a simple linear regression model, to be able to tell if there is any correlation between the amount of salaries and years of experience of any worker in the company and with this model you will be able to predict the amount of salary that will be paid to a worker with an entirely new years of experience, one that is not in the data set given to us.

THIS EQUATION SHOWS THE EQUATION OF THE SLOPE OF A LINE
where y is the dependentt variable 

x is the independent variable 

and b is the co-eefficient

this feat is easilly accomplished by training the model with sklearn.linearreggression
make a value called regressor and train on the train sets for both the dependent and independent variableer 

after training you can then makeyour predition
